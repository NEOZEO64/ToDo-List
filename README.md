# ToDo-List

This is a playground, on which I work on a todo-list-webapp.
The website is built with python &amp; django. [This](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-todo-webapp-using-django/) is the tutorial, which I used to get started.

## Cheat sheet to get started (MacOS / Linux)

1. Install general dependencies, such as python 3 and django
2. Install django & django crispy forms (In my case, I installed it directly, without a virtual environment)
   `pip install django`
   `pip install django-crispy-forms`
3. Go to project root directory
4. Start the webserver with sqlite etc. locally
   `python manage.py runserver`

At the end, you should get something like this:

<img title="Example" alt="example image" src="./example.png">

For further steps, look at the tutorial above. Also, don't expect too efficient, well thought code as I am still a beginner dealing with django & websites.

Have fun with the code!
